# Group 8's: Java Standard

### Rule 1) Explicit over implicit: Be clear and verbose over unreadable and over-simplified. This applies to variable names, functions, errors, classes etc.
### Rule 2) Camelcase naming convention.
### Rule 3) Spaces instead tabs. Indent like you are writing Python.
### Rule 4) Every if should have an else.
### Rule 5) Use a for loop if the number of iterations is knows. While(true) is a no-go.
### Rule 6) Rules for Comments: Comments should not duplicate the code. Good comments do not excuse unclear code.  If you canâ€™t write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.  Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it. Provide links to the original source of copied code. Write comments at incomplete code.
### Rule 7) A function should complete 1 purpose.
### Rule 8) Opening braces are on new lines.
