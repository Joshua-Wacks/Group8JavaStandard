# Group 8's: Java Standard, built upon [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4-formatting)

## (Josh's rules parts 4 & 5)
### Rule 8 (refers to rule 4.1.2) Opening braces are on new lines. Except for empty functions which can be on one line.
### Rule 3 (Refers to rule 4.2) Spaces instead tabs. Indent like you are writing Python. Indentations are 4 spaces.
### Rule 7 (Refers to rule 4.3) A function should complete 1 purpose and one statement per line
### Rule 9 (Refers to rule 4.8.3.1) Arrays should be declared and initialized all on one line, excpet in the case of 2D arrays.
### Rule 6 (Refers to rule 4.8.6) Rules for Comments: Any comment style is allowed such as // but /* */ should be used for larger comments. Comments should not duplicate the code. Good comments do not excuse unclear code.  If you can’t write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.  Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it. Provide links to the original source of copied code. Write comments at incomplete code.
### Rule 2) (No need for this one, it is clear in document) Camelcase naming convention.
### Rule 10) Avoid global variables where possible, for example when using constants.

## (Daniel's rules part 6 and 7)
### Use @Override liberally
### Don't ignore caught exceptions
### Call static methods on class not instance

### Detailed comment for a class at the top of the file
### Comments on methods only where explanation is needed taking into account public methods may require more comments

## Original Rules 
### Rule 1) Explicit over implicit: Be clear and verbose over unreadable and over-simplified. This applies to variable names, functions, errors, classes etc.
### Rule 2) Camelcase naming convention.
### Rule 3) Spaces instead tabs. Indent like you are writing Python.
### Rule 4) Every if should have an else.
### Rule 5) Use a for loop if the number of iterations is knows. While(true) is a no-go.
### Rule 6) Rules for Comments: Comments should not duplicate the code. Good comments do not excuse unclear code.  If you can’t write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.  Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it. Provide links to the original source of copied code. Write comments at incomplete code.
### Rule 7) A function should complete 1 purpose.
### Rule 8) Opening braces are on new lines.
